# Virtual environment in Python

First, create a virtual environment in Python:

[source,bash,run]
----
python -m venv /home/python/sampleenvironment
----

____
Explaination of the command:

* the -m flag runs a library module as a script
* the venv keyword indicates the creation of a virtual environment using
the venv module in Python
* the location of the virtual environment is indicated by
/path/to/new/virtual/environment
____

Next, activate your new virtual environment:

[source,bash,run]
----
source /home/python/sampleenvironment/bin/activate
----

Upon completing this step, the beginning of your command line should
look like this:

____
[!NOTE] If you wish to deactivate your environment at any time, run the
following command `+deactivate+`
____

____
[!IMPORTANT] The following steps will require that your virtual
environment is activated.
____

Ensure that Pip, Pythonâ€™s package manager, is up to date by running the
following command:

[source,bash,run]
----
pip install --upgrade pip
----

`+pip+` is updated quite frequently so it is best to update it natively
like we did above.

The commands below are necessary for our test program, but the packages
you install in your virtual environments will depend entirely on the
requirements of your programs.

In your new environment, run the following command to install the
requests library, which will allow you to make API calls in your
program:

[source,bash,run]
----
pip install requests
----

Next, run the following command to install the Pandas library, which
allows for more readable terminal output of JSON files:

[source,bash,run]
----
pip install pandas
----

Finally, install the package for Tabulate, which will turn our Pandas
output into a table for terminal output:

[source,bash,run]
----
pip install tabulate
----
